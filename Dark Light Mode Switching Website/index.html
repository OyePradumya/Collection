                <h2>Get Ready for Indigenous Peoples’ Day</h2>
                <p>The second Monday in October is Indigenous Peoples’ Day in the United States. The holiday honors the
                    cultures and contributions of Native Americans. It also recognizes the hostilities to which American
                    Indians have been subjected, including displacement, forced assimilation, foreign diseases, and
                    warfare. Learn more about the celebration and the diverse societies that make up the First Nations.
