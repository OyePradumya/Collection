Project Context : We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to 
understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing
to understand about these algorithms is visualization. Made this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms
work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.

Our project visualizes four most commonly used sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort.
User could run the program on a local machine and see how each algorithm works in action, and how elements are swapped in the array to get to the sorted array in the end. 
Our program also measures and displays the actual run-time of each sorting algorithm on the screen.
