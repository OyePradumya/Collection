This project predicts the admission of a student based on different features including university rating, student’s undergrade GPA, GRE score, research experience and etc. This predicts that how much chances are there that the student will get admission in his selected university or not.

In this project I have used multiple algorithms including linear regression, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest regressor, decision tree regressor.
